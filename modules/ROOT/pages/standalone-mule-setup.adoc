== Verify Supported Standalone Mule Versions

Anypoint Visualizer supports the following Mule versions for standalone Mule deployments:

* Mule version 3.8.7
* Mule version 3.9.x
* Mule version 4.1.x
* Mule version 4.2.x
* Mule version 4.3.x

== Install Agent

To support Anypoint Visualizer for standalone Mule deployments, install the xref:monitoring::am-installing.adoc[Anypoint Monitoring agent].

[NOTE]
The APIs and policies that Anypoint Visualizer displays in the Policy visualization come from an update to the agent. As a result, policies are shown in Anypoint Visualizer only if your deployments use an agent from December 19, 2019 or later.

== Enable Header Injection

Anypoint Visualizer requires header injection for standalone Mule deployments so that the deployments display the correct connections.
However, due to a potential performance impact, header injection is disabled by default for Mule version 4.x with Anypoint Monitoring Agent released before April 6, 2020. You must enable header injection at the server (not app) level.
This affects all applications running on the server.

. To enable header injection for apps deployed to a standalone Mule instance, click *Server* in the menu on the left of *Runtime Manager*.
. Select the server for which to enable header injection and click *Manage Server*.
. Click the Properties tab and set the following property in the server:
`anypoint.platform.config.analytics.agent.header_injection.disabled=false`
You must set the property to `false`, as shown in the example to enable header injection, because the property is disabled by default.

Additionally, you must use version 1.5.12 or later of the HTTP Connector in your Mule 4 applications.

=== Manage Performance and Data Collection

The agent that Anypoint Visualizer uses to collect metadata sometimes has a performance impact.

For more information about data collection and performance, see xref:visualizer::manage-performance.adoc[Manage Performance and Data Collection].
