This topic describes how to use Anypoint Visualizer to view a graph of your application network.

The topology of the application network is automatically generated by Anypoint Visualizer. To maximize visualization readability, consumer
 nodes (i.e. nodes that only have outbound connections), are shown at the top, and all backend systems (i.e. nodes with inbound connections only) are shown at the bottom. All consumer nodes are grouped by `ClientId` when possible, and otherwise grouped under the "External Traffic" node.
 For the `ClientId` to be detected, the target application/API/proxy should have the `Client Id enforcement` policy.

When viewing or modifying a graph, Anypoint Visualizer provides the following functionality:

* Undo or redo changes:  use the undo/redo buttons at the bottom-left corner of the canvas to undo/redo your changes
* Zoom control: use the zoom in, zoom out and zoom fit buttons on the bottom-right corner of the canvas to control the zoom. You can also use scroll to zoom in and out.
* Pan the visualization: click and drag on the canvas to pan the visualization

== View an Application Network in an Organization

. From *Management Center*, select Anypoint Visualizer.
+
If Anypoint Visualizer is not available contact your system administrator to ensure that you have the correct permissions to access the application.

. Select an environment from the drop-down list.
+
Anypoint Visualizer displays only the environments you have permissions to view.

. Click the check box for the business group you want to view.

_Result:_ After selecting the organization and environment group, Anypoint Visualizer displays a graph of your application network.

== View Information About All Nodes In Your Network

Use the drop-downs at the top left corner of the canvas to select the metric and the time window that you would like to show for all the nodes in your application network.
One drop-down can be used to select one of the following metrics:

* Inbound connections
* Errors count
* avg. response time
* avg. throughput
* avg. CPU consumption
* avg. memory utilization.

The other drop-down can be used to select the time window used to calculate the average values of the selected metric.

To avoid long numbers, Anypoint Visualizer uses unit prefixes to simplify your view. For example:

|===
| Avg throughput | 66.7m TPM | 66.7 milli transactions per minute | 0.0667 TPM
|===
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix[Here is a quick review of metric prefixes], but note that, in Anypoint Visualizer, `u` represents micro, rather than `Î¼`.

== View Information About a Node in Your Network

When you select a node within the graph, the node and its dependency stack will be highlighted and all unconnected nodes will be grayed out. Anypoint Visualizer displays information about the node in the panel on the right-hand side of the application. This panel is divided into the following sections:

* *Details*: Provides information about the node.
* *Metrics summary*: Provides monitoring metrics for the selected node including Errors count, avg. response time, avg. throughput, avg. CPU consumption, and avg. memory utilization.
* *Metrics chart*: Shows the time-series chart of the selected metric in the *Metric* drop-down.
* *Customization*: Provides information about the layer to which the node is assigned and the tags assigned to the node. You can change the layer and the tags from this section. See xref:layers.adoc[Use Layers in Anypoint Visualizer] and xref:use-tags-in-visualizer.adoc[Use Tags in Anypoint Visualizer].

From the side panel, you can rename a node by clicking the *Rename Node* button.

You can search for a node (service) in the *Search services* text field. Services containing your search in any part of their name will be highlighted, while others will fade.

== View Information About a Connection in Your Network

When you select a connection within the graph, Anypoint Visualizer displays basic information about the connection in the panel on the right-hand side panel of the application.

From the side panel, you can rename the connection by clicking the *Set Edge Name* button.

== Customize Your View of Your Network

Use the filtering feature in the side panel to customize your view and choose what appears in the canvas. You can filter by environments, tags, and services.

This feature enables you to hide the nodes that you do not want to see see in the graph. Filter selections persist after you close Anypoint Visualizer and reload the canvas at a later time.

Note that filters have a cascading design, so all nodes that do not belong to the checked environments or tags are automatically hidden from the list of services. You can check the *Include related services* box to see services that are related to the nodes labeled with the selected tags. The list of services shown in the right-hand panel and the canvas will reflect this selection.
