This topic describes how to use Anypoint Visualizer to view a graph of your application network.

The topology of the application network is automatically generated by Anypoint Visualizer. To maximize visualization readability, "consumer"
 nodes (i.e. nodes that only have outbound connections), are shown at the top, and all "backend systems" (i.e. nodes with inbound connections only) are shown at the bottom. All consumer nodes are grouped by ClientId when possible, and otherwise grouped under the "External Traffic" node.
 For the ClientId to be detected, the target application/API/proxy should have the "Client Id enforcement" policy.

When viewing or modifying a graph, Anypoint Visualizer provides the following functionality:

* Undo or redo changes:  use the undo/redo buttons at the bottom-left corner of the canvas to undo/redo your changes
* Zoom control: use the zoom in, zoom out and zoom fit buttons on the bottom-right corner of the canvas to control the zoom. You can also use scroll to zoom in and out.
* Pan the visualization: click and drag on the canvas to pan the visualization

== View an Application Network in an Organization

. From Management Center, select Anypoint Visualizer.
+
If Anypoint Visualizer is not available contact your system administrator to ensure that you have the correct permissions to access the application.

. Select an environment from the drop-down list.
+
Anypoint Visualizer displays only the environments you have permissions to view.

. Click the check box for the business group you want to view.

_Result:_ After selecting the organization and environment group, Anypoint Visualizer displays a graph of your application network.

== View Information About All Nodes In Your Network

Use the drop-downs at the top left corner of the canvas to select the metric and the time window that you would like to show for all the nodes in your application network.
One drop-down can be used to select one of the following metrics:

* Inbound connections
* Errors count
* avg. response time
* avg. throughput
* avg. CPU consumption
* avg. memory utilization.

The other drop-down can be used to select the time window used to calculate the average values of the selected metric.

In order to avoid long numbers, Anypoint Visualizer uses unit prefixes to simplify your view. For example,

|===
| Avg throughput | 66.7m TPM | 66.7 milli transactions per minute | 0.0667 TPM
|===
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix[Here is a quick review of metric prefixes], but note that, in Anypoint Visualizer, u represents micro, rather than μ.

== View Information About a Node in Your Network

When you select a node within the graph, the node and its dependency stack will be highlighted and all unconnected nodes will be grayed out. Anypoint Visualizer displays information about the node in the details panel on the right-hand side of the application. This panel is divided into the following sections:

* *Details*: provides information about the node, including the layer the node is assigned to. You can change the layer from this section. See xref:layers.adoc[Use Layers in Anypoint Visualizer].
* *Metrics summary*: provides monitoring metrics for the selected node including Errors count, avg. response time, avg. throughput, avg. CPU consumption, and avg. memory utilization.
* *Metrics chart*: Shows the time-series chart of the selected metric in metric drop-down.

From the details panel, you can rename a node by clicking the *Rename Node* button.

You can search for a node (service) in the *Search services* text field. Services containing your search in any part of their name will be highlighted, while others will fade.

== View Information About a Connection in Your Network

When you select a connect within the graph, Anypoint Visualizer displays basic information about the connection in the details panel on the right-hand side of the application.

From the details panel, you can rename the connection by clicking the *Set Edge Name* button.

== Customize Your View of Your Network

Use the filtering feature in the side panel to customize your view and order what appears in the application. You can filter by *environments* and *services*. 

This feature enables you to hide the nodes that you do not want to see see in the graph. Filter selections persist after you close Anypoint Visualizer and reload the canvas at a later time. 

Note that filters have a cascading design, so all nodes that do not belong to the checked environments are automatically hidden from the list of services.
