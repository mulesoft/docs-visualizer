= Supported Connection-Level Metrics
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

Connection-level metrics, or _edge metrics_, are available for many of your connections in the Anypoint Visualizer canvas. Depending on your deployment type (CloudHub, standalone Mule, or Runtime Fabric), some inbound or outbound metrics do not appear at the connection level. You can use this guide to determine why metrics are absent from your canvas.

Metric is Not Available:: Connections appear if there has been traffic between those services in the past 7 days. If there was no traffic for a particular edge in the time range selected on the *Metric* card, however, metrics will not appear on that edge. You may see this message in the card: `Inbound/Outbound metrics are not available for this connection. Learn more.`

[NOTE]
You may also see the same message if you are using a dedicated load balancer. See below.

Metric is Not Applicable:: If support for a type of metric on a connection level is listed as _not applicable_, Anypoint Visualizer does not have access to the data associated with this connection type.
For example, you have selected inbound average response time and have a Mule app calling Salesforce. This metric refers to the average time that Salesforce took to respond to the inbound call. This is not data that Anypoint Visualizer currently registers.
In this case, the following message appears: `Inbound/Outbound metrics are not applicable for this type of connection.`


== CloudHub

The following connection types and directions support or do not support connection-level metrics, depending on the specified requirements and restrictions.

|===
| Connection Type | Supported | Requirements and Restrictions

3+| *Inbound Metrics*
| Client App Group to a Mule App
| Yes
| None

| External Traffic to a Mule App
| Yes
| None

| Mule App to a Mule App
| Yes
| If there has not been traffic in the selected time range, the following message appears: `Inbound metrics are not available for this connection. Learn more.`

| Mule App to a Non-Mule Node
| Not applicable
| None

3+| *Outbound Metrics*

| Client App Group to a Mule App
| Not applicable
| None

| External Traffic to a Mule App
| Not applicable
| None

| Mule App to a Mule App
| Yes
a|

* Outbound metrics on a connection are available only if the destination app is using one of these xref:cloudhub-setup#verify-supported-mule-runtime-engine-mule-versions-for-metrics[Mule versions]. If not, the following message appears:

`Outbound metrics are not available for this connection. You may need to update the runtime version of the destination Mule app.`

* If the dedicated load balancer (DLB) modifies the URL, then metrics are not available for any of the connections passing through the DLB and  the following message appears:

`Outbound metrics are not available for this connection. Learn more.`

| Mule App to a Non-Mule Node
| Yes
| None

== Standalone Mule

The following connection types and directions support or do not support connection-level metrics, depending on the specified requirements and restrictions.

|===
| Connection Type | Supported | Requirements and Restrictions

3+| *Inbound Metrics*
| Client App Group to a Mule App
| Yes
| None

| External Traffic to a Mule App
| Yes
| If there is a connection from external traffic to a Mule app and also a connection from a Mule app using Mule 4.x to the same app, then the Mule-app-to-Mule-app edge metric does not appear; rather, it is averaged into the value shown on the edge from external traffic.

| Mule App to a Mule App
| Yes
| If there has not been traffic in the selected time range, the following message appears: `Inbound metrics are not available for this connection. Learn more.`

| Mule App to a Non-Mule Node
| Not applicable
| None

3+| *Outbound Metrics*

| Client App Group to a Mule App
| Not applicable
| None

| External Traffic to a Mule App
| Not applicable
| None

| Mule App to a Mule App
| Yes
| If the dedicated load balancer (DLB) modifies the URL, then metrics are not available for any of the connections passing through the DLB and the following message appears:

`Outbound metrics are not available for this connection. Learn more.`

This message also appears if there has not been traffic in the selected time range.

| Mule App to a Non-Mule Node
| Yes
| None
