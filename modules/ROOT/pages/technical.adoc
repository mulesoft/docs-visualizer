= How Anypoint Visualizer Collects Application Data
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

Anypoint Visualizer collects runtime information from running applications, APIs, and proxies to detect all of its dependencies. The information collected includes IP and URL (without parameters) of the incoming request, as well as URL (without parameters), and some header values of outgoing requests. This information is stored encrypted in a database.

| org_id | The organization where the node is deployed.

== Disable Data Collection for an Application

The agent that Anypoint Visualizer uses to collect metadata may have a performance impact. 

*CloudHub*

To reduce performance impact for an application running in CloudHub, you can do one of the following:

* Deploy the application using a default Mule runtime engine.
* Disable data collection for a specific application. To disable data collection for an application, set the following application property and redeploy the application:
+
----
anypoint.platform.config.visualizer.agent.enabled=true/false
----


*Standalone Mule Runtime Engines*

To reduce performance impact for an application running in a standalone mule runtime, you can do one of the following:

* Deploy the application using a default Mule runtime engine without the Anypoint Monitoring agent.
* Disable data collection for a specific application. To disable data collection for an application, set the following application property and redeploy the application:
+
----
anypoint.platform.config.analytics.agent.disabled=true/false 
----
+
[NOTE]
This will disable monitoring for that application as well.
