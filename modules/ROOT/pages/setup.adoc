Configure the roles and permissions required to use Anypoint Visualizer and understand what to consider when deploying applications.

== Configure Permissions

To access Anypoint Visualizer, you must be assigned a role that has one of the following permissions:

* *Runtime Manager > Read Applications*: Enables a user to view the graph of an application network, but does not allow them to make changes.
* *Visualizer > Visualizer Editor*: Enables a user to view and modify the graph of an application network. +
You can create a xref:access-management::roles.adoc#custom-roles[custom role] and assign the *Visualizer Editor* permission to it.
[NOTE]
The *Visualizer Editor* permission can only be assigned within the master organization.


== Verify Supported CloudHub Runtimes

Anypoint Visualizer includes activity only from applications deployed to a supported Mule runtime engine. When deploying a Mule application or API, you must ensure that you are using a supported Mule runtime engine as the deployment target.

Anypoint Visualizer supports the following Mule runtime engines running on *CloudHub*:

* Mule Runtime, version 3.9.1+
* Mule Runtime, version 3.9.1-AM
* Mule Runtime, version 4.1.x
* Mule Runtime, version 4.1.x-AM

These versions are listed in *Runtime Manager > Runtime Version*. Expand the *Show old patch releases* section in the runtime versions drop-down.

[NOTE]
====
Anypoint Monitoring metrics appears only for applications running on a Mule `-AM` version. +
You must also update the Mule runtime engine for applications using Mule runtime engines that were released before June 30th 2018 to ensure you have the proper Visualizer agent. You can do this update with zero downtime for CloudHub applications, APIs, and proxies.
====


== Verify Supported Standalone Mule Runtime Engines

Anypoint Visualizer supports the following Mule runtime engines for standalone Mule runtime engine deployments:

* Mule Runtime, version 3.8.5+
* Mule Runtime, version 3.9.1+
* Mule Runtime, version 4.1.1+


== Standalone Mule Runtime Engine Setup

To support Visualizer for standalone Mule runtime engine deployments, you must xref:monitoring::am-installing.adoc[install the Anypoint Monitoring agent]. 


== Verify Supported Connectors

Anypoint Visualizer can monitor activity for outbound connections on specific connectors.

For Mule runtime engine version 3.9.x, the following connectors are supported:

* Salesforce
* HTTP/HTTPS
* Database
* All connectors based on the Connector DevKit

For Mule runtime engine, version 4.1.x, the following connectors are supported:

* Salesforce
* HTTP/HTTPS
* Database
* Mule 4 Extension Connectors


== Deploy an Application

When you deploy an application you want to view in Anypoint Visualizer, ensure that you select a supported version of Mule runtime engine as the deployment target. See xref:runtime-manager::index.adoc[Runtime Manager] for more information.

After redeploying an application, all metadata collected by Anypoint Visualizer is removed for that application. The number of inbound connections for the application node is reset.

== Disable Data Collection

The agent that Anypoint Visualizer uses to collect metadata may have a performance impact. 

*CloudHub*

To reduce performance impact for an application running in CloudHub, you can do one of the following:

* Deploy the application using a default Mule runtime engine.
* Disable data collection for a specific application. To disable data collection for an application, set the following application property and redeploy the application:
+
----
anypoint.platform.config.visualizer.agent.enabled=true/false
----


*Standalone Mule Runtime Engines*

To reduce performance impact for an application running in a standalone mule runtime, you can do one of the following:

* Deploy the application using a default Mule runtime engine without the Anypoint Monitoring agent.
* Disable data collection for a specific application. To disable data collection for an application, set the following application property and redeploy the application:
+
----
anypoint.platform.config.analytics.agent.disabled=true/false 
----
+
[NOTE]
This will disable monitoring for that application as well.
