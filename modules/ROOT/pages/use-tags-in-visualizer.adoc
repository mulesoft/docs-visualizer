You can add tags to an application, proxy, or other service. Similar to layers, there are two ways of assigning a tag to a node: by using properties or through the Anypoint Visualizer UI.

If a tag is assigned to an application, the application will appear in every view in which the tags are selected.

== Setting the Tag Through Properties

You can automate adding tags to nodes by using `anypoint.platform.visualizer.tags=<name>, <name>`, either in the application's properties file or at deployment time through the Runtime Manager UI or API. Note that this is an application property, not a server property.

When you use this property, the nodes automatically show the assigned tags in the *View* card of Anypoint Visualizer. You can add but cannot override tags in the UI. Additionally, you can modify the tags only in properties. All the letters in the tag names are displayed in lowercase.

In the following example, the tag `project-b` was added through properties and therefore cannot be modified on the canvas.

== Set Tags Using the UI

By default, when you first view a node using Anypoint Visualizer, it does not have any tags assigned. You can assign a tag to an existing node using the UI if it does not already have the same tag applied through properties.

. In the Architecture visualization, select the application node to tag. +
You can hold the shift key to select multiple nodes to apply tags to all the selected nodes at once. +
_Result:_ The *Customization* section for the node appears in the *Details* tab of the node's card as shown in the following image:
+

. In the *Customization* section, click *+ Add tag* as shown in the following image:
+
image::add-tag.png[]
. Type the name of the tag to apply. Existing tags appear in a drop-down list as you begin to type. +
You can either: +
* Select an existing tag, or
* Enter a name for a new tag, and click *Create tag <your-tag>*, or
* Enter a name for the new tag, and press enter. +
[NOTE]
You cannot apply the same tag to one node multiple times. All tags are converted to lowercase.
+

+
_Result:_ The tags that you added to a node are listed in the *Customization* section. This node is included in the list of services if you xref:view.adoc#customize-view[filter by this tag].

== Delete a Tag

You can delete tags from Anypoint Visualizer. Deleting a tag does not delete the associated nodes.

To delete a tag assigned using the `anypoint.platform.visualizer.tags=<name>` property, return to the applicationâ€™s properties file and delete the assignment `anypoint.platform.visualizer.tags=<name>`.

To delete a tag that was configured in the UI:

. In the Architecture visualization, select a node with the tag you wish to delete.
. Locate the tag in the *Customization* section, and click the *X* on the tag to delete.
